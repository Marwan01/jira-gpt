## How to update the types

The exported components depends heavily on the types defined in the `@atlassian/forge-ui-types` package, but since the `@atlassian/forge-ui-types` is private, we copy over all of the type definitions into the `types` folder instead.

To get the latest type definitions, follow these steps:
1. Open the file `packages/forge-ui/build/bundle-types.sh`
2. Change the `VERSION` variable to the version of the `@atlassian/forge-ui-types` package you want to pull use. For example: `VERSION=27.3.0`
3. In your terminal, go to the folder `packages/forge-ui`
4. Run the command `yarn run pack`
5. The types from the `@atlassian/forge-ui-types@VERSION` should now be in the `packages/forge-ui/src/types` folder
